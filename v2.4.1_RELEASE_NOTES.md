# 🎉 Farm Merger Pro v2.4.1 - Release Notes

## ✨ Ultra-Modern Glassmorphism Edition

Your Farm Merger Pro just got a **complete makeover**! We've redesigned every pixel to deliver the smoothest, most beautiful automation tool you've ever seen.

## 🎨 What's New

### 1. **Glassmorphism UI - Premium Feel** ✨
Your app now features an ultra-modern glassmorphism design with:
- **Smooth glass-like panels** with semi-transparency
- **Vibrant blue accents** (#58B2FF) with purple gradients
- **Ultra-smooth rounded corners** (14-24px everywhere)
- **Perfect spacing** for professional appearance
- **Pure white text** (#FFFFFF) for maximum clarity

**Before:** Basic dark theme  
**After:** Premium glassmorphism with smooth transitions

### 2. **Preview Window Close Button - FIXED** 🐛
The annoying bug where preview windows wouldn't close is **completely fixed**!
- **X button works** - Click to close instantly
- **ESC key works** - Cancel anytime
- **Smooth exit** - Returns to GUI perfectly

**Issue:** Preview wouldn't close when clicking X  
**Fixed:** Added proper window protocol handler

### 3. **Better Button Names** 🏷️
We renamed the template collection buttons to match what you actually do:
- **🎯 Collect** (was "📸 Capture Items")
- **🎮 Game UI** (was "📸 Capture UI")
- **✂️ Cut Items** (was "📸 Producers")

Much clearer and more intuitive!
